# PyQt-QMainWindow-Resize-Event-Example
This code shows how to implement the resize event for a "QMainWindow" class in PyQt.

To capture the resize event of a QMainWindow class, the method resizeEvent() method
must be overrrided.

The resize event is called whenever the window is resized in the windowing system, either directly 
through the windowing system acknowledging a setGeometry() or resize() request, or indirectly through 
the user resizing the window manually.
